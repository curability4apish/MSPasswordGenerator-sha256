Forked from [Ayukawayen/MSPasswordGenerator](https://github.com/Ayukawayen/MSPasswordGenerator). To enhance security, the original SHA-1 algorithm in sha1.js is replaced with SHA-256 algorithm with the help of Github Copilot. Names of any objects, sha1 for example, haven't been changed. The algorithm needs rigorous inspection.
