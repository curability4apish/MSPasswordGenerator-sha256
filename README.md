Forked from Ayukawayen/MSPasswordGenerator. To enhance security, the original SHA-1 algorithm in sha1.js is replaced with SHA-256 algorithm with the help of Github Copilot.

This repository is forked, and still in beta. Names of any objects, sha1 for example, haven't been changed. The algorithm needs rigorous inspection.
