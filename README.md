## About
Forked from Ayukawayen/MSPasswordGenerator. To enhance security, the original SHA-1 algorithm in sha1.js is replaced with SHA-256 algorithm with the help of Github Copilot. Names of any objects, sha1 for example, haven't changed.

## Plans
* The encryption algorithm needs rigorous inspection.
* Logging should be disabled.
* Password storage needs encryption.
